		<p>Mama always told me don’t you run Don’t you run with scissors,
			son You’re gonna hurt someone Mama told me look before you leap
			Always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep Stay
			along the beaten path, never listened when she said Sharp edges have
			consequences I guess that I had to find out for myself Sharp edges
			have consequences Now every scar is a story I can tell</p>

		<p>Should’ve played safer from the start Loved you like a house of
			cards Let it fall apart But all the things I couldn’t understand
			Never could’ve planned They made me who I am Put your nose on
			paperbacks Instead of smoking cigarettes These years you’re never
			getting back Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said
			Sharp edges have consequences I guess that I had to find out for
			myself Sharp edges have consequences Now every scar is a story I can
			tell</p>
