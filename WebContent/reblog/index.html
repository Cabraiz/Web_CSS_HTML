			<p>FACT OF LIFE #1: We don’t read pages. We scan them. One of the
				very few well-documented facts about Web use is that people tend to
				spend very little time reading most Web pages. Instead, we scan (or
				skim) them, looking for words or phrases that catch our eye. The
				exception, of course, is pages that contain documents like news
				stories, reports, or product descriptions, where people will revert
				to reading—but even then, they’re often alternating between reading
				and scanning.</p>

			<p>FACT OF LIFE #2: We don’t make optimal choices. We satisfice.
				When we’re designing pages, we tend to assume that users will scan
				the page, consider all of the available options, and choose the best
				one. In reality, though, most of the time we don’t choose the best
				option—we choose the first reasonable option, a strategy known as
				satisficing. 1 As soon as we find a link that seems like it might
				lead to what we’re looking for, there’s a very good chance that
				we’ll click it.</p><br>
